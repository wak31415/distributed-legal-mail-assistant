erasure, cancellation
To Whom It May Concern:
I no longer feel confident in your ability to secure my compensation on my behalf, and I will be enquiring to instruct other solicitors. I hereby inform you that I no longer wish to be part of this claim effective immediately. I expect a written reply confirming the cancellation as well as the removal of my information from your systems within one week.
Regards,
Dr Beetroot Coddlesworth, Esq.
